# Tugas Kecil 2 Strategi Algoritma - Closest Pair of Point

Finding the closest pair of points in 2D is a classic problem in computer science which the aim is to find two points that are closest to each other. The shortest distance between two points is known as the minimum distance.

This program's main goal is to create a program that finds the nearest pair of points in 3D space, but we eventually expanded it to work in n-dimensional space where n is larger than or equal to 1. For three-dimensional space, there is a visualizer that can show the pair of nearest points among a set of points.

## Features

1. Input: The users can choose to input using file or generate random input.
2. Timing: At the end, the program will output the elapsed time that the program used to execute (exclude users input).


## Repository Structure
1. `src` folder contains the source code (`.py` files).
2. `test` folder contains the file to input it manually (`.txt` files).
3. `doc` folder contains report of the project.

## Requirement
- **Python 3**
## How to Run
Open Command Line from the parent directory and execute the jar file using the following command.

```sh
python .\src\main.py
```
